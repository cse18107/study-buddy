    <h2 class="topic-title">Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p class="topic-description">
      Chloroplasts are membrane-bound organelles that are internally divided in a manner that separates and facilitates the reactions required for photosynthesis. Inside each chloroplast, the light-dependent reactions take place in membrane-bound sacs called thylakoids, which provide the specific location for these reactions. A stack of thylakoids may be referred to as a granum, and multiple granum are called grana, highlighting the organized structure within chloroplasts. The internal space of each thylakoid is connected to adjacent thylakoids, which helps coordinate the processes needed for photosynthesis within the chloroplast. This structural organization supports the conversion processes involved in photosynthesis as described in the context.

    <h2 class="topic-title">Overview of Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p class="topic-description">
      During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is brought into the stroma and participates in a series of reactions that ultimately lead to the formation of organic molecules. In the Calvin cycle, carbon atoms from CO2 are incorporated into molecules such as RuBP, forming intermediate compounds that are progressively converted into three-carbon molecules. Through these reactions, energy becomes stored in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon compound, is the immediate product of photosynthesis that can be further processed to form larger carbohydrates. The cycle is arranged so that enough RuBP is regenerated to allow the process to continue.

    <h2 class="topic-title">Location of Photosynthesis</h2>
    <p class="topic-description">
      Within cells, photosynthesis involves structures such as thylakoids and the surrounding stroma. The light-dependent reactions occur in the membrane of the thylakoids, where various pigments like chlorophylls and carotenoids absorb energy from sunlight. These reactions include the initial phase known as Photosystem II, in which water molecules are broken down into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen. The fluid-filled stroma around the thylakoids is the site where light-independent reactions take place. Together, the thylakoid membranes and the stroma provide the locations where different stages of photosynthesis occur.

    <h2 class="topic-title">Chloroplast Structure</h2>
    <p class="topic-description">
      Within chloroplasts, there are thylakoids whose interiors form the thylakoid space or lumen. Surrounding the thylakoids is a fluid-filled space called the stroma. Light-independent reactions take place in the stroma. Light-dependent reactions, which are known as photosystems, occur within the membrane of the thylakoids. These reactions involve various pigments that absorb energy from sunlight.

    <h3 class="topic-title">Thylakoids and Grana</h3>
    <p class="topic-description">
      During photosynthesis, as carbon fixation occurs in the stroma, other chloroplast structures such as thylakoids and grana provide the internal organization needed for the process. Thylakoids are membrane-bound sacs that form part of the chloroplast’s internal membrane system. These thylakoid membranes define a separate internal space called the thylakoid lumen. Stacks of these thylakoid sacs are arranged into structures known as grana. The thylakoid lumen is involved in proton accumulation, which is an important aspect of the internal environment during photosynthetic reactions.

      Light-dependent reactions are reactions requiring the presence of light and are known as photosystems. These reactions take place within the membrane of the thylakoids, where the various pigments that absorb energy from sunlight are located. The pigments involved usually include some combination of chlorophylls and carotenoids that capture light energy. Photosystem II (PS II) is the initial phase of photosynthesis in which water molecules are broken down into hydrogen ions (H+), electrons (e-), and oxygen.
